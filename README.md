Welcome  to the Norwegian Blue Parrot project. It is a series of articles for demystifying AI and Deep-Learning through jovial, in-depth descriptions, fun  interactive, and a touch of geekiness.

# Introduction

Welcome to the first "Norwegian Blue Parrot" project article. For each AI project, I write the code and show you how it works. You can test it using a mobile phone, tablet, and laptop (on the website, https://nbp3-webclient-2020.web.app/). Furthermore, you can see for yourself the effectiveness and the shortcoming of each AI model.

I have developed dozens of AI projects, and with each AI model, I learn a bit more insights  into the world of Artificial Intelligence.

The audience or point of view  (POV) for demystifying AI is primary for AI enthusiasts and friends with a curious mind. However, I am a full-stack programmer, a solution architect, and an AI scientist, and therefore, I will not shy away from the math and the coding, but I will remain steadfast to the primary POV.

Before digging into the technicalities, we will have fun test-driving  the AI model. After we have a firm grasp on "what" we are trying to demystify, we will travel a full journey from coding to gathering the data. We will take a break to understand the particular data biases , both the conscious biases and the unforeseen consequences. We will reach the journey conclusion at the use-cases, i.e., what is the purpose of this AI project, and what other possibilities could this AI model can be used either ethically or  feloniously.

The "k2fa" AI project is for kids to learn about farm animals. Think of "k2fa"  as kids wandering through a farm and naming the animal that they see.

More concisely, "k2fa" is Deep Learning Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) image classification model.

Before charging ahead with an in-depth explanation, let's test the "k2fa" kids. Show the "k2fa" kids a picture, and they will identify it. Scroll down  to the "Prediction section" and have fun.
